—Facts about FPGA—🧐
🔹FPGA's enable flexible, reconfigurable computing, as most enable the user to reprogram the hardware circuit with different logic functions.
🔹According to the report, “The global FPGA market was worth USD 9.0 billion in 2018 and is estimated to develop at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.7% from 2020 to 2027.” The growing need for higher bandwidth at a low cost and low power generates advanced embedded FPGA architecture opportunities.
